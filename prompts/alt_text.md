I've attached an image for you to see. Please briefly summarize what it contains, to create an alt text for it.

Your output should be:
<alt>description here</alt>

It will composed of a medium and a subject, usually something like
<alt>Photo of an apple on a desk at night, with a notebook on the left</alt>
or for something more unusual:
<alt>Graph of quarterly revenue with a playful cartoon rocket in the top-right corner, boosting toward an annotation bubble</alt>
